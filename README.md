## 🤖 My Robotics Car Project

As part of my first hands-on robotics build, I developed a **Wi-Fi controlled robotics car**. The objective was to design a car that could be operated via smartphone or remote, stay within a defined track, avoid obstacles, and reach the finish line efficiently.  

### 🔧 Key Features & Components
- **ESP32 microcontroller** with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth  
- Smartphone-based control via Wi-Fi for extended range  
- Power system using **6×AA NiMH rechargeable batteries** with a charger  
- **Step-down converters** to safely regulate voltage for the ESP32  
- Robotics car kit (with additional Arduino board for future projects)  
- Essential electronics tools: wires, wire stripper, and planned additions like a breadboard and multimeter  

### 📌 Current Status
The project has been successfully completed and tested. While two minor errors remain, this build marks my entry into **hardware-software integration** and gives me a strong foundation for more advanced robotics work.
